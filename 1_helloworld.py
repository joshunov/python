# Let's start with a programmer's classic: Hello World!

print("Hello Josh!")

# This is the only line of active code in the file. All the other 
# lines here are comments; these are for humans and the computer
# will not read them. To make a comment, put a # in front of the line.

# Just like Word reads `.docx` files, Python reads `.py` files;

print(5)
print(2+7)
print(33*4)
